README for XIcon version 1.0                                    04 Jan 1993

XIcon is a conversion program for translating icons between various
formats.  It was written by Norman Walsh <norm@ora.com> using EMX/GCC.  

XIcon reads:

  Mac icon resources (raw resource forks)
  Windows icon files
  X11 XBM files
  OS/2 v1.2 Icon files
  OS/2 v2.0 Icon files

XIcon writes:

  OS/2 v1.2 Icon files
  OS/2 v2.0 Icon files
  Windows Icon files (well, sortof--it's mostly untested)
  X11 XPM files

My appologies for the poor documentation and hideous command line options
of this program.  For a brief summary of the available options, run XIcon
without any parameters.  Here is a brief summary:

  xicon <options> input output

Will convert the icons in "input" into OS/2 1.2 icons in "output".

  GENERAL OPTIONS
    -2  Write an OS/2 2.0 icon file instead
    -w  Write a Windows icon file instead (largely untested)
    -x  Write an XPM3 icon file instead
  
  OPTIONS FOR MAC RESOURCES
    -p  Use Mac palette rather than OS/2 palette.
    -I  Don't include ICN# resources (32x32x1 images)
    -#  Don't include ics# resources (16x16x1 images)
    -l  Don't include icl4 resources (32x32x4 images)
    -s  Don't include ics4 resources (16x16x4 images)
  
  OPTIONS FOR XPM FILES
    -a  Write all the icons.  Since XPM files can only contain a single icon,
        xicon normally translates only the first icon found.  If -a is 
        specified, the output filename is used as a pattern and "#.xpm" is
        appended to it.  If the output file is "test", xicon will create
        "test1.xpm", "test2.xpm", etc...
  
    -R  Specifies an alternate colors database file.  XPM files contain color
        names.  In order to determine what names to use, xicon reads the
        "rgb.txt" file in /usr/local/lib/X11.  If your rgb.txt file is 
	somewhere else...  Note: if you don't use X11, you probably don't have 
	an rgb.txt file, so one is supplied in this distribution.  Of course, 
	if you don't have X11, you probably don't have much use for XPM files 
	either...
       
  OPTIONS FOR XBM FILES 
    -f  Set foreground color to 'C'.  
    -b  Set background color to 'C'
  
        C=0..15 or 't' for transparent, or 'r' for reverse of background.
  
    -r  Don't reverse the bit order of the bytes in the file.
    -m  Set mask file.  The mask file is ANDed with the background and the 
        image.
  
  OPTIONS FOR MAC FILES ONLY
    -p  Use Mac palette rather than OS/2 palette.
    -I  Don't include ICN# resources (32x32x1 images)
    -#  Don't include ics# resources (16x16x1 images)
    -l  Don't include icl4 resources (32x32x4 images)
    -s  Don't include ics4 resources (16x16x4 images)
