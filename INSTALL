Install instructions for XIcon:

  - Compile XIcon with gcc.  Oh, it might work with some other compiler,
    but I haven't tried...

  - For OS/2, I use Eberhard Mattes port of gcc.  You might need to change
    the #ifdef lines that reference __EMX__ if you are using a different
    gcc.

  - In ./src, modify the Makefile to suit your system.  Run make to build 
    XIcon.  For more information look in the Makefile.

  - If you want to output XPM3 files, you must have 'rgb.txt' in 
    /usr/local/lib/X11.  If you don't have a copy of rgb.txt (it is standard
    in the X11 distribution), you can use the one in ./lib, however, you
    will have to remember to use -R to point to it...

  - Caveat: I've been lazy and some of the filenames don't fit in 8.3.  But
    they're all unique in 8.3...

  - DOS and OS/2 users who do not already have the EMX runtime installed 
    should unpack and install ./emxrt.zip.  If you already have the EMX
    runtime installed, this step is unnecessary.  Always make sure you 
    are using the most recent EMX runtime, if possible.  This distribution
    includes EMX 0.8h.

If you have any questions or problems, feel free to send me email.  I will
help if I can.

(If you add more options, please send them to me to incorporate into the
"standard" distribution).
