CHANGES for XIcon 

v1.0: (04 Jan 94)

  - Added ability to read OS/2 icons
  - Added ability to write XPM files

    The -a option appends a number to the end of the suggested output.
    It's sort of crude.  If you supply an output filename of TEST, 
    xicon will write TEST1.xpm, TEST2.xpm, ...
